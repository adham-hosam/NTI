# Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)

## Overview

The Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) is a project aimed at enhancing vehicle safety and driver comfort by integrating various sensors, actuators, and control algorithms. This system provides real-time monitoring of vehicle parameters and assists the driver in making informed decisions while driving.

## Features

### 1. Cruise Control System (CCS)

The CCS maintains a constant speed set by the driver, reducing the need for manual throttle control. It adjusts the throttle or brake to maintain the desired speed, enhancing driving comfort on long journeys.

### 2. Speed Sensor (SPS)

The Speed Sensor monitors the vehicle's speed and provides feedback to the control system. It enables features such as speed limit enforcement, adaptive cruise control, and automatic braking systems.

### 3. Driver Monitoring

The system continuously monitors the driver's activity, ensuring alertness and responsiveness during driving. It detects signs of drowsiness or distraction and alerts the driver to take corrective action.

### 4. LCD Display

An LCD display provides real-time feedback to the driver, showing vehicle status, speed, gear position, time, date, and other relevant information. It enhances situational awareness and facilitates interaction with the system.

### 5. Keypad Interface

A keypad interface allows the driver to interact with the system, adjusting settings, activating/deactivating features, and navigating through menus. It provides a user-friendly interface for controlling the ADAS functions.

## Implementation

The ADAS system is implemented using a combination of hardware components (sensors, actuators, microcontroller) and software algorithms. The software is written in C language and executed on a microcontroller platform.

Key components of the implementation include:

- Timer-based interrupt routines for periodic tasks such as relay control, timekeeping, and speed monitoring.
- Initialization functions for configuring peripheral modules such as keypad, LCD, LED, buzzer, and ADC.
- Task functions for handling specific system functionalities such as CCS control, driver monitoring, and LCD display update.
- Integration of sensor inputs, control logic, and feedback mechanisms to ensure seamless operation of the ADAS system.
